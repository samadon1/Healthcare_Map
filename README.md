# Healthcare_Map
Here's a map I created presenting an overview of healthcare accessibility in Ghana. It answers the question: Where should we build a new medical facility to best reach underserved populations?

It computes the approximate travel time from every point to the nearest hospital (darker is longer). 

The Accessibility to Cities data and the Friction Surface used in this 
demonstration are both available in the Earth Engine data catalog.
I'm currently experimenting with the Open Buildings dataset (which is also available in the data catalog) to answer the same question.

The Earth Engine App can be found at this link:
